A Mastermind-like game for Pythonista

The game is self-explanatory. Colored square responses indicate a correct card in the correct position.
White square responses indicate a correct card not in the correct position. You're playing against Pythonista,
which uses an optimum fair strategy. You're allowed to cheat by looking at Pythonista's guesses, and the number
of possible words for you and Pythonista is displayed. An arbitrary number of cards and columns is achieved by
editing the code.
